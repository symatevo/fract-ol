## Summary

In this project, you are required to create a program that can generate and display various fractal patterns. The program should provide an interactive graphical interface that allows users to zoom in/out, pan, and change parameters to explore the fractals in real-time.

## Skills to Learn

- Graphics Programming
- Fractal Generation
- Interactive User Interface
- Real-Time Rendering

## The "Fractol" Program

### Usage

```bash
./fractol [fractal_name]
```

### Description

The "Fractol" program generates and displays various fractal patterns based on the user's input. The program should provide an interactive graphical interface that allows users to explore the fractals in real-time.

The available fractals could include popular ones like the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Burning Ship fractal, and more.

## Project Constraints

- The program should display the fractals using graphics libraries like MiniLibX or similar.
- The program should allow users to zoom in/out and pan through the fractals.
- The program should be interactive and respond to user inputs in real-time.
- The fractals should be generated based on user-selected parameters and formulas.

## Example Usage

```bash
$> ./fractol mandelbrot
```

```bash
$> ./fractol julia
```
